loopdata change history
-----------------------

1.2.2 06/28/2020

Introduced SUM_ and FMT_SUM_ prefixes for daily totals of observations.
This is most useful for rain, where SUM_rain (or FMT_SUM_rain) will yield
today's cumultive rainfall.

1.2.1 06/27/2020
Inexplicably, just a version bump.  No other changes.

1.2 06/27/2020

Fixed issue where loop thread was created multiple times.


1.1 06/27/2020

Fixes to work with Metric/Mixed database and to correctly target
non-US reports.


1.0 01/19/2020

Initial release of loopdata.
