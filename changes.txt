loopdata change history
-----------------------

1.3.4 07/02/2020

Installer uses FMT_SUM_rain rather than FMT_day_rain_total in LoopData section of weewx.conf.
day_rain_total is not emitted by many drivers and was a source of confusion.

1.3.3 07/02/2020

Refrain from trying to format the sum of unix_epoch observations.

1.3.2 07/02/2020

Catch FMT_SUM_ formatting exceptions and print error to log with obstype,
unit_type and unit_group.

1.3.1 06/30/2020

Fixed issue when specifying port in rsync section.  RsyncUpload was expecting a string
for port, loopdata was passing an int.

1.3 06/29/2020

Introduced AVG_/FMT_AVG_ and WAVG_/FMT_WAVG_ prefixes for today's average
and weighted average of an observation, respectively.

1.2.2 06/28/2020

Introduced SUM_ and FMT_SUM_ prefixes for today's totals of observations.
This is most useful for rain, where SUM_rain (or FMT_SUM_rain) will yield
today's cumultive rainfall.

1.2.1 06/27/2020
Inexplicably, just a version bump.  No other changes.

1.2 06/27/2020

Fixed issue where loop thread was created multiple times.


1.1 06/27/2020

Fixes to work with Metric/Mixed database and to correctly target
non-US reports.


1.0 01/19/2020

Initial release of loopdata.
