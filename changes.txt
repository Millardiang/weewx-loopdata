loopdata change history
-----------------------

2.8 Release ?? ??? 2020
-----------------------
1. Add support hour tag.
Note: The sample skin is updated to use the hour tags.
      For existing installations that actually use the
      sample skin, you need to add the following fields
      to the fields clause in the LoopData section in
      weewx.conf:
          'hour.outTemp.max.formatted'
          'hour.outTemp.min.formatted'
          'hour.rain.sum.formatted'
          'hour.wind.rms.formatted'
          'hour.windGust.max'
          'hour.windGust.max.formatted'
2. In addition to the already supported trend.barometer.desc,
   trend.barometer.code is also supported.  The code can
   be an integer between -4 and 4, where the value
   correspsonds to:
   -4 Falling Rapidly
   -3 Falling Quickly
   -2 Falling
   -1 Falling Slowly
    0 Steady
    1 Rising Slowly
    2 Rising
    3 Rising Quickly
    4 Rising Rapidly

3. windrun and beaufort (the deprecated syntax for beaufort) now work correctly.

4. Experimental feature -- It is likely these observations will be moved to a
                           separate plugin (and available to loopdata).
   current, 10m, trend, hour and day periods now support windrun_<dir>.  That is,
   the following (which can be used to make a windrose):
   windrun_N
   windrun_NNE
   windrun_NE
   windrun_ENE
   windrun_E
   windrun_ESE
   windrun_SE
   windrun_SSE
   windrun_S
   windrun_SSW
   windrun_SW
   windrun_WSW
   windrun_W
   windrun_WNW
   windrun_NW
   windrun_NNW

2.7.2 Release 16 Nov 2020
-------------------------
1. Fix for customer reported problem.  Exception in
   code when no rainyear fields are included in
   fields list.

2.7.1 Release 28 Aug 2020
-------------------------
1. Ignore aggreagate fields base on xtypes as there are
   no day accumulators from which to reconstruct inital
   values at start up for these fields.

2.7 Release 11 Aug 2020
-----------------------
1. Bug fix for accumulators at startup from daily summaries.
   The daily summary was not being selected in each accumulator
   range.
2. Include tests where week_start is 0 (rather than default 6).

2.6 Release 9 Aug 2020
----------------------
1. Include sample report LoopDataReport to demonstrate
   capabilities of the loopdata extension.

2.5 Release 2 Aug 2020
----------------------
1. Add support for week, month, year and rainyear.
2. Add LoopData>LoopFrequency>seconds setting in weewx.conf.
   This should be set to the number of seconds between
   loop packets.  This is needed to pass the proper
   weights to the accumulator.  This setting defaults
   to 2.5 (2.5 seconds is the frequency of loop packets
   for the Davis Vantage Pro 2).
3. Limit time_delta used for trends to 259200 (3 days).

2.5.b2
------
Fix for LoopFrequency being ignored (was always using default).
Delay accumulator creation until the station time is known (first loop packet).

2.5.b1 Release
--------------
1. Add support for week, month, year and rainyear.
2. Add LoopData>LoopFrequency>seconds setting in weewx.conf.
   This should be set to the number of seconds between
   loop packets.  This is needed to pass the proper
   weights to the accumulator.  This setting defaults
   to 2.5 (2.5 seconds is the frequency of loop packets
   for the Davis Vantage Pro 2).

2.0.1 Release
-------------
1. Handle case where driver emits packets in a unit_system
   other than the database unit_system.

2.0 Release
-----------
1. The release is identical to rc0; except for a small
   type annotation change and additional tests.
2. Updated documentation (README).

2.0.rc0 07/22/2020
------------------
Release Candidate 0
1. Fix regression in day accumulator introduced in 2.0.b14.
2. Add test to cover above (added a previous day packet
   so that tests cover a day boundary.
3. Only accumulate specified day fields in the day accumulator.

2.0.b15 07/21/2020
------------------
1. Breaking change.  If loop_data_dir is a relative path, it
   is now relative to the target_report directory.  After
   installing, check loop_data_dir before you restart WeeWX.
2. Default target_report is now WeatherBoard (it was Seasons).
3. For new installs of WeatherBoard and LoopData, this will
   now work out of the box for all flavors of WeeWX 4/Py3.7+
   installs.

2.0.b14 07/21/2020
------------------
[No user facing changes (but please report issues).]
1. Internal refactoring so that tests use identical code
   path on each loop packet as production uses.

2.0.b13 07/21/2020
------------------
[No user facing changes (but please report issues).]
1. Clean up dead code.
2. Simplify creation of target report converter.

-----------------
1. trend no longer restricted to barometer.

2.0.b6 07/13/2020
-----------------

   renamed in weewx.conf (LoopData fields), your Cheetah templates/JavasScript.

1.3.19 07/09/2020
-----------------
1. Catch and log setup errors.  Allow WeeWX to continue with LoopData.

2. Update one test.

1.3.10 07/05/2020
-----------------
1. Redo how 10m max gust is handled when windGust not in packet.
   Simply substitue windSpeed for windGust.
2. Test overriding km_per_hour label in weewx.conf Defaults>Units.
3. Add test of CC3000 packets.
4. Add test of IP100 packets.
5. Add test of Simulator packets.

1.3.9 07/05/2020

1. Properly construct dictionary of target_report so formatting
   and conversion actually does what it should.
2. Fix a problem reported by a user running pyflakes.  USUnit
   wasn't qualified.
3. Fix an issue reported. windGust was assumed to be in the
   packet.  Now, if not present, max windSpeed in the archive period
   accumulator stats is used to compute 10m gust.

1.3.8 07/05/2020
----------------
Require at least Python 3.7.
Handle None for windSpeed and and windDir in the database (as some drivers write None rather than omitting).

----------------
Refactor loopdata.py to facilitate testing.

1.3.6 07/04/2020
----------------
Add tests for conversions and formatting:
weewx.METRIC   -> metric reports
weewx.METRIC   -> us     reports
weewx.US       -> metric reports
weewx.US       -> us     reports
weewx.METRICWX -> metric reports
weewx.METRICWX -> us     reports

1.3.5 07/03/2020
----------------
Converting to report units was being done correctly for observations.
This release fixes conversions for highs, lows, sums, averages and weighed averages.

1.3.4 07/02/2020
----------------
Installer uses FMT_SUM_rain rather than FMT_day_rain_total in LoopData section of weewx.conf.
day_rain_total is not emitted by many drivers and was a source of confusion.

1.3.3 07/02/2020
----------------
Refrain from trying to format the sum of unix_epoch observations.

1.3.2 07/02/2020
----------------
Catch FMT_SUM_ formatting exceptions and print error to log with obstype,
unit_type and unit_group.

1.3.1 06/30/2020

--------------
Introduced AVG_/FMT_AVG_ and WAVG_/FMT_WAVG_ prefixes for today's average
and weighted average of an observation, respectively.

1.2.2 06/28/2020
----------------
Introduced SUM_ and FMT_SUM_ prefixes for today's totals of observations.
This is most useful for rain, where SUM_rain (or FMT_SUM_rain) will yield
today's cumultive rainfall.

1.2.1 06/27/2020
----------------
Inexplicably, just a version bump.  No other changes.

1.2 06/27/2020
--------------
Fixed issue where loop thread was created multiple times.


1.1 06/27/2020
--------------
Fixes to work with Metric/Mixed database and to correctly target
non-US reports.


1.0 01/19/2020
--------------
Initial release of loopdata.
